# Instructions for accessing my code: 
## 1. Install Python
On Windows:
Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Download the latest version (e.g., Python 3.12) The code was developed in 3.11.9 but should work in other versions. 

IMPORTANT: During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".

Click "Install Now".

On macOS:

Download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

On Linux:
Open Terminal and run:
~~~
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
~~~
## 2. Check That Python is Installed
Open a terminal/command prompt and run:
~~~
python --version
~~~
or 
~~~
python3 --version
~~~
You should see something like Python 3.12.x.

## 3. Install Pygame
Run the following in your terminal:
~~~
pip install pygame
~~~

## 4. Run the Game
Download 2048.py and save to a path you can access easily (i.e. desktop)

Use cd to navigate to the folder where your file is in (using "copy file as path" in explorer can help)

In your directory, type
~~~
python 2048.py
~~~
It should look like this:
~~~
C:\Users\linde\OneDrive\Desktop\2048> python 2048.py
pygame 2.6.1 (SDL 2.28.4, Python 3.13.1)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
~~~
And will open the game
