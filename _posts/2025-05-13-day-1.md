### What I Set Out to Do
My initial goal was to gather as much information about the game mechanics of 2048 and how to use pygame.

### What I Actually Did

#### Pygame

##### First, I looked at the pygame documentation and found the essential functions to get started. I found this demo of a basic pygame setup:
~~~
# Example file showing a basic pygame "game loop"
import pygame

# pygame setup
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
running = True

while running:
    # poll for events
    # pygame.QUIT event means the user clicked X to close your window
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # fill the screen with a color to wipe away anything from last frame
    screen.fill("purple")

    # RENDER YOUR GAME HERE

    # flip() the display to put your work on screen
    pygame.display.flip()

    clock.tick(60)  # limits FPS to 60

pygame.quit()
~~~~
I played around with this code and modified it to make
##### epilepsy.py
~~~
import pygame
import random
# pygame setup
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
running = True

while running:
    color = pygame.Color(random.randint(0,255),random.randint(0,255),random.randint(0,255))
    # poll for events
    # pygame.QUIT event means the user clicked X to close your window

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # fill the screen with a color to wipe away anything from last frame
    screen.fill(color)

    # RENDER YOUR GAME HERE

    # flip() the display to put your work on screen
    pygame.display.flip()

    clock.tick(2)  # limits FPS to 60

pygame.quit()
~~~
This helped me understand what all the parts of the code did and I practiced using random and pygame together.

#### **2048 research**

##### For my research, I started with playing many games of 2048, which was fun. There were some statistics I was still curious about, so I consulted the 2048 wikipedia page for information on how some of the game mechanics work. The game starts with 2 numbers in random places. New numbers generate in completely random empty squares every time a move is made, which disproved my previous notion that they generate based on which direction you move. Also, there is a 90% chance for a new number to be 2 and a 10% chance for it to be a 4.

### What I Learned or Noticed

By 

For example: 
   * This: ✅ “During class, we discussed dictionaries and I realized that I can use them to organize player stats way more cleanly than using parallel lists.”

   * NOT this: ❌ “This week helped me realize I actually enjoy debugging when I understand the bigger picture.”]
