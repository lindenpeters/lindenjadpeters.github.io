### What I Set Out to Do
My initial goal was to gather as much information about the game mechanics of 2048 and how to use pygame. 

---

### What I Actually Did

First, I looked at the pygame documentation and found the essential functions to get started. I found this demo of a basic pygame setup:
~~~
# Example file showing a basic pygame "game loop"
import pygame

# pygame setup
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1280, 720))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
running = True

while running:
    # poll for events
    # pygame.QUIT event means the user clicked X to close your window
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # fill the screen with a color to wipe away anything from last frame
    screen.fill("purple")

    # RENDER YOUR GAME HERE

    # flip() the display to put your work on screen
    pygame.display.flip()

    clock.tick(60)  # limits FPS to 60

pygame.quit()

### What I Learned or Noticed

[What did you take away from your work this week?
It could be technical (like learning how to use Pygame or CSS Grid), strategic (such as finding a better way to plan), or personal (like discovering how you stay motivated). Your takeaway might be small (figuring out a tricky method or function) or big (like realizing how much you’ve grown as a problem solver).
Try to be specific—

For example: 
   * This: ✅ “During class, we discussed dictionaries and I realized that I can use them to organize player stats way more cleanly than using parallel lists.”

   * NOT this: ❌ “This week helped me realize I actually enjoy debugging when I understand the bigger picture.”]
