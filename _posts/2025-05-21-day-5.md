### What I Set Out to Do
Today was the most important part: making the mechanic for merging tiles. 
---

### What I Actually Did

I started with the left function. My first attempt was messy, since I was kind of lost. I decided to go through every row, iterate 4 times (kind of arbitrary), and delete 0s (adding them at the end later). If there is a non zero, check if there is a number behind it and add the index of the behind one to the merged number. 
~~~
def left(squares):
  for row in squares:
    for i in range(4):
      if row[i] == "0":
        del row[i]
      elif row[i] != "0":
        num = row[i]
        behind = row[0:i]
        if num in behind:
          index = behind.index(num)
          row[index] = str(int(row.pop(i))*2)
      while len(row) < 4:
        row.append("0")
~~~~
This code was not the best, and it introduced errors such as not working all the time, merging more times than the original game permits (tiles are only allowed to merge once per turn).
With this in mind, I tried this new design:
~~~
def left(squares):
  for r in range(4):
    # convert to int for easy processing and getting rid of 0s
    row = [int(x) for x in squares[r] if x != "0"]
    # using while loop since we change the length of the loop
    i = 0
    while i < len(row)-1:
      # check if the adjacent number is equal
      if row[i] == row[i + 1]:
        # Multiply the number by 2 and delete the adjacent number (it is ahead and this is the left function)
        row[i] *= 2
        del row[i + 1]
        # Iterating through while loop
        i += 1
      else:
        i += 1
    # Padding the right with zeros after moving left
    while len(row) < 4:
      row.append("0")
    # sending the updated row back to squares
    squares[r] = [str(x) for x in row]
~~~
This updated code got rid of the zeros so I only had to worry about the relations between neighboring numbers. I also converted everything to an int so the logic would be easier. 
I then used a similar logic, except backwards for the right function:
~~~
def right(squares):
  for r in range(4):
    # convert to int for easy processing and getting rid of 0s
    row = [int(x) for x in squares[r] if x != "0"]
    # using while loop since we change the length of the loop
    i = -1
    while i > -(len(row)):
      if row[i] == row[i - 1]:
        row[i] *= 2
        del row[i-1]
        i -= 1
      else:
        i -= 1
    while len(row) < 4:
      row.insert(0,"0")
    squares[r] = [str(x) for x in row]
~~~
Next, I needed to do the vertical functions. I started with down.
I knew that I had already had very similar code for right and left, but I needed to make it column major. 
I changed my list comprehension a little bit in a way that for every column c, it would find that index in each row, removing the 0s like before.
~~~
  for c in range(4):
    # convert to int for easy processing and getting rid of 0s
    # similar to before except col major, goes through each row r with a set column c
    col = [int(squares[r][c]) for r in range(4) if squares[r][c] != "0"]
    # using while loop since we change the length of the loop
~~~
Then, I added the logic from the right function
~~~
    i = -1
    while i > -(len(col)):
      if col[i] == col[i - 1]:
        col[i] *= 2
        del col[i-1]
        
      else:
        i -= 1
    while len(col) < 4:
      col.insert(0,"0")
~~~
Finally, I needed to save it back to the list. Again, I used a nested for loop to save.
~~~
    for r in range(4):
      squares[r][c] = col[r]
~~~
Lastly, the up function. I applied a mix of the left and down function as shown:
~~~
def up(squares):
  for c in range(4):
    # convert to int for easy processing and getting rid of 0s
    # similar to before except col major, goes through each row r with a set column c
    col = []
    for r in range(4):
      if squares[r][c] != "0":
        col += [int(squares[r][c])]
    # using while loop since we change the length of the loop

    i = 0
    while i < len(col)-1:
      if col[i] == col[i + 1]:
        col[i] *= 2
        del col[i + 1]
        i += 1
      else:
        i += 1
    while len(col) < 4:
      col.append("0")

    for r in range(4):
      squares[r][c] = col[r]
~~~

### What I Learned or Noticed

Through my process, I further solidified the notion we developed a lot in class that a problem can have many different solutions, and the goal is to find the easiest/most effective one. Although I was far from creating a perfect code, creating my logic was a great excercise in lists and looping, as well as an excuse to develop some of my weaker areas such as list comprehension.

### What's Next

This was the last day! However there are some errors such as the down function not working properly if it is used first, although if it used after a few other merges then it works fine (The bugs in this project have been so weird). Also some game-finishing logic, polishing, and coloring could be very nice.
