## What’s One Thing You’d Tell Someone Starting This Course?

For someone starting this course, I would really recommend asking for help when you need it. It might sound like a simple and cliche thing to say, but often times it is easy to find yourself stuck, and scared to ask for help. This will not help at all, as you will continue to be stuck without anyone knowing. Even in situations where it is not allowed to recieve help, it is still helpful to communicate that you are struggling so people can understand and maybe help you in ways you didn't expect. It is always better for other people to know what is happening rather than struggling alone.

## What Did You Learn That Might Stick With You?

What did this project teach you—about programming, learning, or yourself? You can talk about a specific concept you finally understood, a skill you improved, or a moment you felt proud of your work or proud of yourself!

## What Helped You Get Through Challenges?

How did you handle bugs, confusion, or lack of motivation? What would you tell someone who hits a roadblock and isn’t sure how to keep going?

## What’s Next for You?

What are you planning to focus on after this class—another project, a different course, an artistic or academic goal? Even if it’s not related to CS, how might the skills you practiced here (like logical thinking, problem-solving, or creative debugging) show up in the future?
