title: "Day 3 - Putting together GUI"

### What I Set Out to Do
My goal was to implement a GUI to display what I already developed in a 4x4 grid.

### What I Actually Did

First, I researched several solutions for putting text in pygame. It seemed to involve a module called Font:
~~~
pygame.font
pygame module for loading and rendering fonts
pygame.font.init
initialize the font module
pygame.font.quit
uninitialize the font module
pygame.font.get_init
true if the font module is initialized
pygame.font.get_default_font
get the filename of the default font
pygame.font.get_sdl_ttf_version
gets SDL_ttf version
pygame.font.get_fonts
get all available fonts
pygame.font.match_font
find a specific font on the system
pygame.font.SysFont
create a Font object from the system fonts
pygame.font.Font
create a new Font object from a file
~~~
These functions and their paremeters were very confusing though. After looking around, I saw a youtube video with a simple guide on drawing text in pygame.
I followed their steps carefully to make this function to easily draw text whenever I need:
~~~
text_font = pygame.font.SysFont("Arial",30)
def draw_text(text, font, text_col,x,y):
    img = font.render(text, True, text_col)
    screen.blit(img, (x,y))
~~~
Then, I set up a basic usage of this function to show the list:
~~~
draw_text(str(squares), text_font, (0,0,0),0, 125)
~~~
I then needed to turn it into a grid. I did a little more looking and found a function called **pygame.draw.line**
I used it with a for loop to create the 4x4 grid:
~~~
for i in range(0,4):
        pygame.draw.line(screen,(0,0,0), (125*i,0), (125*i,500))
        pygame.draw.line(screen,(0,0,0), (0,125*i), (500,125*i))
~~~
Next, I needed the numbers. I used the draw_text function from before combined with another for loop.
~~~
for j in range(0,4):
            draw_text(str(squares[i][j]),text_font, (0,0,0),125*j + 50, 125*i+50)
~~~
Overall, I finished adding the graphical interface. It's no visual masterpiece, but it clearly represents 2048.

### What I Learned or Noticed
I learned about how to put text in pygame. It was a lot harder than I expected, and was the first major roadblock in my progress. I realized the value of walkthroughs, since sometimes documentations aren't clear enough. I will make sure to make my own documentations clear and easy to understand in the future.

### What's Next

The next stage of my project will be to start working on my game logic with analyzing and merging the grid.
