### What I Set Out to Do
My goal was to start working on the framework for my game logic that would allow the game to work.

### What I Actually Did

When I tried running the game, I realized I had a bug! When displaying just the squares list printed out, it worked fine, but when I tried running it in the grid, it didn't. Sometimes no numbers would update after several keyboard inputs, and then multiple would show at the same time. I initially thought the lack of response to my inputs was a performance error, and tried various solutions like lowering the framerate. However, after a lot of time spent excruciatingly analyzing the code, I ended up realizing it was simply an index error. I was at least glad that my graphics system was working though.

Next, I worked on changing my list to a 2d array, as that would be easier to perform operations on.
I started with this simple code:
~~~
squares = ["0"*4]*4
~~~
Then, I looked at my inital generation from before:
~~~
for i in range(2):
    random_square = 2 + 2 * (random.randint(1,10) == 10)
    random_index = random.randint(0,15) 
    squares[random_index] = random_square
~~~
I needed to map to the 2d array rather than a 16x1 like before. I remembered the operations we had done using integer division // and modulus %. I used integer division by 4 to map the random number to a row in the list, and used the remainder to find the point in the row. However, THIS ALSO DIDN'T WORK
When I ran the code, it was a complete mess and it seemed to generate numbers in half of the empty squares rather than just 2. Based on my previous shenanigan, I assumed that it was 
~~~


### What I Learned or Noticed
I realized that embarrassingly, I am still not very good at list indexing. Although using lists and loops together is powerful, it is often very hard for me to visualize and keep track of what's going on without extensive tracing.

### What's Next

The next stage of my project will be to start working on my game logic with analyzing and merging the grid.
