title: "Day 2 - Starting generation framework"
---

### What I Set Out to Do
My goal was to start creating a framework for the code, using pygame to create a system using a list. Upon generation, the list has 2 random numbers in random places, and every time an arrow key is pressed one more generates in a random open square.

---

### What I Actually Did

First, I made a list to represent the squares:
~~~
squares = [0]*16
~~~~
Then, I set up a basic code to generate 2 random numbers in random positions before the infinite pygame loop starts.
~~~
# iterating twice
for i in range(2):
    # generating random number with 10% chance of a 4
    random_square = 2 + 2 * (random.randint(1,10) == 10)

    # random index from 0 to end of list
    random_index = random.randint(0,15)
    
    squares[random_index] = random_square
~~~
Then, in the loop, I added the random generation feature whenever the arrow keys are pressed using pygame events:
~~~
while running:
    events = pygame.event.get()
    for event in events:
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        # Filling a random number every time a key is pressed
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key in (pygame.K_LEFT, pygame.K_RIGHT, pygame.K_UP, pygame.K_DOWN):
            # uses the enumerate feature to count indices and evaluate if it is 0
            empty_indices = [i for i, v in enumerate(squares) if v == 0]
            
            if empty_indices:
                # using random choice in the empty indices
                new_index = random.choice(empty_indices)

                
                squares[new_index] = 2 * (random.randint(1, 10) == 10)
                print(squares)

    screen.fill(color)
    
    for i in range(0,4):
        pygame.draw.line(screen,(0,0,0), (125*i,0), (125*i,500))
        pygame.draw.line(screen,(0,0,0), (0,125*i), (500,125*i))
        for j in range(0,4):
            draw_text(str(squares[(i*4)+j]),text_font, (0,0,0),125*j + 50, 125*i+50)
    """
    draw_text(str(squares), text_font, (0,0,0),0, 125)
    """
    pygame.display.flip()
~~~
All in all, I finished the generation aspect of the program, and there is a functional code which starts the grid with 2 random numbers (90% chance of 2 and 10% chance of 4) in random places. Every time an arrow key is pressed (which will later trigger a merge), a new random number generates in an empty space.

### What's Next

The next stage of my project will be to set up the GUI to visualize what I have so far.
