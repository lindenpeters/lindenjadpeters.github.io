### Project Focus

##### For my project, I will be creating the game 2048. The object is to use the arrow keys to combine squares to get to the number 2048. The final product will include a GUI and fully functioning logic.

### Why This Project 

##### I have always loved the game 2048. The mix of puzzle-solving and a fast pace makes the game very addictive. I think this is the perfect difficulty to challenge me but still have something feasibile.

### What I Want to Learn

##### I hope to learn pygame, a python graphics module. I also hope to enhance my programming logic by crafting the complicated system of the puzzle. Also, I would love to create a finished project without giving up.

### My Approach 

##### I will begin by studying the pygame documentation and determining the useful information to learn. I will also dissect the game itself to understand all the under the hood mechanics. After the initial phase, I will make a prototype which will use a 4x4 array with basic functions such as being able to merge with other identical numbers in a certain direction and collide next to them otherwise. Hopefully I can finish the prototype in 3-4 days, which will leave the rest of my time for combining the two steps and turning my basic logic into a working game with a GUI. I will stay faithful to the general structure of the game although I might play around with how I can artistically display it.

### What's Next

My first stage will be researching and gathering the needed information about pygame and how 2048 works. Until next blog!
