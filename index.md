## About Me

Hi, I'm Linden, a student interested in game design. I have never programmed a serious game from start to finish, so this was my first time.
This project was part of my final quest in Programming Fundamentals, and it reflects what I’ve learned about coding with lists, and more generally using all the tools in my toolbox that I have developed this semester.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** **2048**   
**One-line pitch:** A game where you combine tiles to try to get the number 2048.
