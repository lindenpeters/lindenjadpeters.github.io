## About Me

Hi, I'm Linden, a student interested in game design.  
This project was part of my final quest in Programming Fundamentals, and it reflects what I’ve learned about [theme—e.g., creativity, code, perseverance].

## About My Project

**Project Title:** **2048**   
**One-line pitch:** A game where you combine tiles to try to get the number 2048.
